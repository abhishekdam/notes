JavaScriptÂ® (often shortened to JS) is a **lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions**, and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser environments as well. It is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm scripting language that is dynamic, and supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.

Technically, it might be compiled as well. For example, Google Chrome's V8 engine uses a JIT compiler. Like, initially it will be interpreting but the profiler will keep a check on what code can be optimised and it will convert it into bytecode (compile it) for better performance. So, it depends basically on engine to engine implementation. [Read here for more reference.](https://blog.usejournal.com/is-javascript-an-interpreted-language-3300afbaf6b8)
